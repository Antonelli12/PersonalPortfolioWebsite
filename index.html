      <h2>About¬†Me</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I‚Äôm Gus, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Greenwich,
        currently pivoting into the world of cybersecurity. While I started in software development,
        I‚Äôve since redirected my focus toward ethical hacking, Red Teaming, and offensive security.
      </p>

      <h3>My¬†Background</h3>
      <p>
        Before diving into tech full-time, I spent over a year working in hospitality, first as a bartender,
        then quickly promoted to Front of House Team Leader. That fast-paced and high-pressure environment sharpened my leadership,
        communication, and crisis management skills all of which I now apply to problem-solving in cybersecurity.
      </p>

      <h3>What I'm Doing Now</h3>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm actively working through Security+, Network+, and PenTest+ certifications to build a solid foundation
        in network defence and attack simulation. Alongside my studies, I‚Äôm building hands-on projects such as
        a Python port scanner, Linux-based log forwarding system, and packet analysis write-ups using Wireshark.
      </p>
      
      <h3>My¬†Mission</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to ethically expose vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.
        I‚Äôm especially interested in adversary simulation, intrusion tactics, 
        and building offensive tools, all while staying committed to lifelong learning,
        personal growth, and real-world impact.
      </p>

      <h3>Spoken¬†Languages</h3>
      <p>
        I'm fluent in English and Portuguese, and I speak Spanish at a conversational level.
        This multilingual skill set helps me communicate and collaborate across diverse environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Values</h3>
      <ul class="about-values">
        <li>‚öîÔ∏è  Offensive mindset, ethical purpose</li>
        <li>üí° Learn by doing</li>
        <li>üõ†Ô∏è Build, break, rebuild</li>
        <li>üéØ Focused goals, long-term vision</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div class="skills-flex-wrapper">
      <p class="skills-paragraph">
        The tools shown here reflect how I work: hands-on, curious, and driven by real-world scenarios.
        I spend a lot of time in Kali and other Linux environments, using the terminal as my base of operations,
        whether it‚Äôs inspecting packets with Wireshark, probing networks with Nmap, or scripting my own utilities in Python.
        I use Syslog setups to experiment with log centralisation and alerting, often mimicking how events might be handled in a SOC environment.
        You might notice a few ‚Äúweb stack‚Äù tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tucked in here.
        Those are a nod to my background in software engineering before I fully committed to cybersecurity.
        They‚Äôve proven useful when exploring client-side exploits or building lightweight dashboards.
        All of this supports my current focus on Security+, Network+, and PenTest+ as I work toward a future in Red Team operations.

  <!-- WHY CYBERSECURITY -->
  <section id="why-cybersecurity" class="section-card">
    <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p class="cyberstory">
    My journey into cybersecurity, and probably computer science as a whole, began with what I believe is the most important question: ‚ÄúHow does this work?‚Äù<br><br>
    Ever since I was a kid, I‚Äôve had an almost compulsive curiosity about the inner workings of things. I‚Äôd spend hours staring at our CRT television 
    wondering what was happening inside it, and although my parents never let me open it up (for good reason), the urge to take it apart and understand
    it never really left me. I pulled apart other electronics, took toys to pieces, and explored anything I could safely dismantle.
    That mindset stayed with me as I grew up.<br><br>
    I was also raised during a time when people around me still described the internet as the ‚Äúwild west‚Äù, warning me to be careful with downloads
    because of malware and viruses. That constant sense of caution sparked a lot of questions. 
    What exactly was malware? How did it work? How could I protect my own computer? 
    And, eventually, could I build something like that myself ‚Äî just to understand how attackers thought and operated?<br><br>
    That blend of curiosity and challenge is what drew me into cybersecurity. Over time, I discovered how deep the rabbithole goes.
    The media often portrays hackers as keyboard magicians, but the reality is more compelling. 
    Real cybersecurity work is about strategy, persistence, and lateral thinking. It‚Äôs technical, but also creative, and the stakes are real.<br><br>
    What excites me most is the offensive side of the field. My ultimate goal is to work in Red Teaming and offensive security. 
    I genuinely believe I thrive when it comes to thinking like the enemy. I enjoy exploring systems, spotting weaknesses, and approaching problems from unexpected angles.
    There‚Äôs something uniquely satisfying about using those skills to ethically test and improve defences.<br><br>
    <em>‚ÄúAs they say, the best defence is a good offence.‚Äù</em></p>
